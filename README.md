Geolocation of Unknown Receiver using DL SL signal

I tried different classification algorithms to classify 10 different geolocation by channel characteristics (channel coefficients) which is between the transmitter array (5x5x5=125 antennas), and the 10657 active receivers in old dataset (labelData).

I also tried different classification algorithms to classify 10 different geolocation by channel characteristics (channel coefficients) which is between the transmitter array (512 antennas), and the 464,780 active receivers in old dataset (labelDataOffset).
